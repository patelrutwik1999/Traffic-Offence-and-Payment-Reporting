					<h1 class="message2">Road Saftey</h1>
					<p>In today’s world road and transport has become an integral part of every human being. Every body is a road user in one shape or the other. The present transport system has minimized the distances but it has on the other hand increased the life risk. Every year road crashes result in loss of lakhs of lives and serious injuries to crores of people.</p>

				<div class="row">
   					 <div class="col-md-8">
        					<p>It is an established fact that safe and efficient use of the traffic environment is a learned behaviour. All road users are the products of some form of education or training, however informal or intermittent. The importance of a formal training in road safety has been underestimated in the past because of the mistaken belief that the lessons to be learned are simple and the tasks to be performed rudimentary.</p>
        					<p>Ahmedabad Traffic Police established a Road Safety Cell in 1972 to generate awareness among road user. It is an educational wing of the Ahmedabad Traffic Police and its main function is to educate the road users as regards the proper and safe use of roads as well as to develop the human resources who are responsive to public and are technically competent. The training programme is meant to encompass the whole range of road using citizens, from a common pedestrian to a vehicle driver.</p>
